# From Silos to Service Topology: Why Netflix Built a Real-Time Service Map

_By_[ _Parth Jain_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parth-jain-8a09abb6/), [_Rakesh Sukumar_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raskuma/) _,_[_Yingwu Zhao_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yingwu-zhao-62037418/) _,_[_Renzo Sanchez_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renzosanchezsilva/) _ & _[_Nathan Fisher_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathfisher/) _ ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]
How we built a living map of our distributed infrastructure to help engineers understand dependencies, troubleshoot faster, and keep Netflix running smoothly for our members around the world. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### The Puzzle with a Thousand Pieces

Picture this: It's 3am, and an engineer gets paged. One of our critical services is showing elevated error rates. Members trying to watch their favorite films and series are seeing degraded experiences. The clock is ticking. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

A single service at the center of a web of dependencies — services, data stores, and call chains branching in every direction. Without a unified map, engineers have to reason about this structure from memory and scattered signals. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

In a system with thousands of microservices supporting our entertainment experience for members worldwide, answering these questions quickly can mean the difference between a minor blip and a major incident. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

We kept hearing variations of this story from engineers across Netflix. The tooling gap was clear: we had plenty of signals, but no unified way to understand how everything connected. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### The Three Questions Every Engineer Asks

When troubleshooting distributed systems, engineers fundamentally need to understand relationships: ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Which services depend on each other?** Not just theoretical dependencies from configuration files or architecture diagrams, but actual runtime connections based on real traffic. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**What's the blast radius?** When something breaks or needs to go down for maintenance, what else will be affected? Which teams need to be notified? ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Where's the source?** Is my problem caused by an upstream issue, or am I the root cause that's cascading to others? ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

Traditional observability tools show fragments of this picture. Metrics show symptoms and performance characteristics. Logs show individual service behavior. Traces show single request flows through the system. But none of them show the complete map of how everything connects — the steady-state topology of dependencies that forms the backbone of our distributed architecture. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

For an engineer at 3am, having to mentally stitch together information from multiple tools is slow, error-prone, and stressful. We needed something better: a unified view of service dependencies — a map showing how everything connects — with easy navigation to the detailed signals when you need to dig deeper. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### Why This Matters More Than Ever

Netflix runs on thousands of microservices working together to deliver entertainment to our members. When you press play on your favorite series, that single action triggers a cascade of service-to-service calls — authentication, recommendations tailored to your tastes, video encoding selection, playback optimization, and more. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

This architecture gives us tremendous flexibility and allows hundreds of engineering teams to innovate independently. But it also creates fundamental observability challenges. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

And these challenges were growing. New initiatives like our Live programming and Ads-supported plans require even more sophisticated monitoring and faster troubleshooting. Live events can't wait for lengthy incident investigations. The scale and real-time nature of these systems demanded better tooling. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

We analyzed thousands of support requests from our engineers over a four-year period. The patterns were consistent: ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

  * "What are my upstream and downstream dependencies?"
  * "Is this failure in my service, or is something I depend on broken?"
  * "Which services will be impacted if I take this down for maintenance?"
  * "Why is this service showing as 'Unknown' in my metrics?"
  * "What changed in my call path recently that could explain this behavior?"

Engineers were asking dependency questions constantly. We needed to provide answers — quickly, accurately, and in real-time. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### Building on What We Learned

We didn't start from scratch. Over the years, we explored various approaches to solving this problem — from evaluating external graph databases and vendor platforms to building internal prototypes with different storage technologies and data models. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

#### Each iteration taught us something valuable:

**Real-time matters:** Dependency maps that are hours old are useless in dynamic environments where services deploy multiple times per day. We needed near real-time updates. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Scale changes everything:** Solutions that work at modest scale hit fundamental walls at Netflix scale. Storage systems that handle thousands of nodes struggle with our service count and traffic volume. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Integration is key:** Any solution needs seamless integration with our existing observability ecosystem. Engineers shouldn't have to learn entirely new tools or leave their existing workflows. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Data quality is critical:** Incomplete or incorrect dependency information is worse than no information — it leads to wrong conclusions during incidents. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Multiple perspectives needed:** We learned that no single source of dependency information tells the complete story. Network connectivity data lacks application context. Application metrics only cover instrumented services. We needed to combine multiple sources. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

These lessons shaped every decision we made in building Service Topology. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### What We Needed: A Living Map

We set out to build something specific: a living map of our infrastructure — one that updates in real-time as services deploy, as traffic patterns shift, as new dependencies form and old ones disappear. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

The requirements were clear: ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]


**Real-time updates, not stale snapshots:** In an environment where services deploy continuously, yesterday's topology map is archaeology, not observability. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Fast queries at scale:** When an engineer is troubleshooting at 3am, they can't wait minutes for a query to return. We needed sub-second response times for traversing the call graph. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Multiple layers:** Network-level connectivity doesn't tell the whole story. We needed to see both the network layer (what's actually talking to what) and the application layer (which APIs and endpoints are being called). ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Rich context, not just connections:** Knowing Service A talks to Service B isn't enough. We needed to overlay health status, availability tiers, business domains, ownership information, and other metadata to make the information actionable. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Visual and programmatic access:** Engineers needed a UI for exploration and troubleshooting. But automated systems — resilience frameworks, blast radius calculators, incident response automation — needed programmatic API access. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### Our Approach: Three Sources of Truth

Three data sources produce three independent topology graphs — network, application, and request — each stored separately and queryable on their own or merged into a single unified view. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

Here's the key insight we arrived at: no single source tells the complete story. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

We built Service Topology by using three complementary sources to build separate dependency graphs — one from each perspective — that can be combined into a unified view or explored independently: ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

Each source creates its own graph that is physically separate — the network layer in one graph database partition, the IPC layer in another partition, and the tracing layer using columnar storage optimized for analytical queries. This physical separation allows each layer to evolve independently and be queried in parallel. When users request a unified view, we execute traversal queries across all layers simultaneously and merge results, achieving sub-second response times even when combining all three layers. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

Each source creates its own graph of service relationships: ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

#### 1\. eBPF Network Flows (Network Layer)

We capture network flow records at the kernel level using eBPF technology — information about which services are connecting to which other services over the network. This gives us ground truth about actual network-level communication. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

The value: Comprehensive coverage. Every service shows up here because we're capturing actual network traffic, regardless of whether applications are instrumented. This layer provides topology at both cluster-level (which deployment clusters are communicating) and app-level (which applications are communicating). ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

The limitation: Network-level information lacks application context. We know Service A connected to Service B's IP address using a specific protocol, but not which specific API endpoint or path was called (e.g., /api/v1/users vs /api/v1/orders). ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

#### 2\. IPC Metrics (Application Layer)

We collect Inter-Process Communication metrics from our instrumented services. These are the metrics applications emit when they make calls to other services via gRPC, GraphQL, REST, or other protocols. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

The value: Rich application context. We can see which specific endpoints were called, error rates, latency distributions, protocol details, and request/response characteristics. This layer provides app-level topology — since IPC metrics are emitted by applications, the natural granularity is application-to-application connections with endpoint details. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

The limitation: Only works for instrumented services. If a service doesn't emit IPC metrics, we won't see its application-level calls this way. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

#### 3\. End-to-End Tracing (Request Layer)

We integrate distributed tracing information that follows individual requests as they flow through our system. We aggregate traces to build a unified topology graph, but also allow engineers to overlay individual traces on the topology to see specific request flows. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

The value: Shows actual request paths. Not just "Service A _can_ call Service B," but "Service A _did_ call Service B as part of serving this specific member request." This captures runtime behavior, including conditional logic and feature flags. Engineers can both see the aggregated pattern and drill into individual traces. We aggregate traces to build topology at both cluster-level and app-level, allowing engineers to view request patterns at the granularity most useful for their investigation. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

The limitation: Sampling. We can't trace every request without impacting performance, so we sample. This is excellent for understanding common flows, but may miss rarely-used code paths in the aggregated view. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

#### Bringing It Together: Multi-Layer Architecture

Here's what makes this powerful: we build three separate graphs — one from each source — that create different perspectives on service relationships: ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

  * **Network graph from eBPF flows:** Every connection, regardless of instrumentation
  * **Application graph from IPC metrics:** Rich endpoint and protocol details
  * **Request graph from tracing:** Actual runtime behavior and call paths

Engineers can: 

  * View each graph independently to focus on a specific perspective (pure network connectivity, application-level calls, or traced request flows)
  * Combine them into a unified graph by querying multiple partitions in parallel and merging results — our system returns the union of nodes and edges from all requested layers while preserving each layer's distinct properties

The unified view is especially powerful because: ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]


  * Network flows ensure completeness — we don't miss anything
  * IPC metrics provide application details — we understand the "how" and "what"
  * Tracing shows actual behavior — we see real request patterns

Each source compensates for the limitations of the others. The result is a comprehensive, accurate, and contextualized view of service dependencies that can be explored from multiple angles. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### From Flows to Graph: How We Built It

Here's the high-level architecture (we'll dive deeper into engineering challenges in our next post): ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

Flow logs travel from multi-region Kafka through three aggregation stages — initial batching, intermediary resolution, and final enrichment — before being persisted to the graph database and served via API. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Multi-Region Ingestion:** We consume flow logs from Kafka across multiple AWS regions where Netflix operates. This runs continuously, processing millions of flow records as they arrive. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Distributed Processing:** We use Apache Pekko Streams (a fork of Akka) to process these flows in a distributed, fault-tolerant pipeline. The system automatically partitions work across our Auto Scaling Groups to handle the volume and provides natural backpressure handling. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Three-Stage Distributed Aggregation** : We aggregate network flows through a three-stage pipeline that solves a fundamental challenge: network flow logs only show individual network hops through intermediaries (App A → Load Balancer → App B, or App A → NAT Gateway → App B), not the true application-level connections we need (App A → App B). ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

Stage 2 resolves network intermediaries: raw flow logs show two separate hops (App A → Load Balancer → App B), but the resolved graph stores the direct application-to-application relationship (App A → App B). ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

Stage 1 performs initial aggregation from Kafka. Stage 2 applies resolution logic — identifying network intermediaries (load balancers, NAT gateways, API gateways, proxies) and combining their incoming and outgoing flows to reconstruct direct application-to-application paths. Stage 3 performs final aggregation with health status integration before graph persistence. This graduated approach also prevents hot spots by distributing load across multiple points even when specific applications or network intermediaries see 100x more traffic than others. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

Graph Storage: We persist the topology in Netflix's graph database, an abstraction layer built on top of our distributed key-value storage infrastructure. This graph database is specifically designed for high-throughput graph operations at our scale, with fast multi-hop traversal capabilities. Each of our three data sources (network flows, IPC metrics, tracing) creates a separate graph that can be queried independently or merged. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

gRPC API: We expose the topology through a gRPC service that supports multi-hop traversal, filtering by availability tier and business domain, pagination for large result sets, and sub-second query response times. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

The technical details of building this at Netflix scale — handling Kafka lag, managing memory and garbage collection, optimizing distributed processing, debugging reactive streams — deserve their own discussion. We learned a lot, and we'll share those lessons in our next post. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### What Engineers Can Do Now

Today, the service topology map is helping engineers across Netflix: ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Visualize Dependencies:** See upstream and downstream dependencies for any service, with the ability to filter by availability tier (Tier 0, Tier 1, etc.) and business domain. Choose between the unified view (combining all sources) or individual graph views (network-only, IPC-only, or trace-only) depending on what you're investigating. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Jump to Detailed Signals:** From any service in the topology, quickly navigate to logs, traces, and detailed metrics in their respective tools. No more hunting for the right service name or time window — the topology provides the context and the starting point. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Understand Blast Radius:** Before taking a service down for maintenance or making significant changes, see exactly what will be impacted. Identify which teams to notify and what to monitor. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Overlay Health Status:** See not just the topology, but which services in the call path are experiencing issues. This is integrated with health status tracking, so you can quickly identify if a problem you're seeing is actually originating somewhere else. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Query Programmatically:** Use our gRPC API to integrate topology information into automated systems. For example, our Platform Modernization Engineering team uses this to verify that critical Live services have proper availability tier classifications throughout their dependency chains. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Investigate Faster:** During incidents, quickly identify if a failure is local or if it's propagating from somewhere else in the call graph. Follow the failure pattern to find the root cause. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Plan Changes Confidently:** Understand the impact of proposed architectural changes or service migrations before implementing them. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

**Time Travel Through Topology:** Query what the topology looked like at specific points in the past. Understand what changed in dependencies around the time an issue started, or see how your service's dependency footprint has evolved over time. This time-travel capability is powered by time-window aggregation — instead of storing every time slice separately, we use layer-specific aggregators that accumulate topology data across windows, allowing us to reconstruct historical views efficiently without exploding storage costs. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### The Living Map: Always Current

What makes this truly useful is that it's a living map. It's not a static diagram drawn in a design document that goes out of date the moment it's published. It's continuously updated based on actual traffic: ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

  * When a new service starts calling an API, it appears in the topology with near real-time freshness
  * When a service stops making calls to a dependency, that edge fades from the graph
  * When services deploy and their behavior changes, the topology reflects it
  * When incidents impact service health, the status overlay updates in real-time

This means engineers can trust what they see. The map reflects reality, not someone's idea of what the architecture should be. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### The Journey Continues

We're not done. We continue to evolve the system with new capabilities: ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

Change Event Overlay: We're working to surface deployment events, configuration changes, and other mutations alongside the topology graph. Correlation becomes easier when you can see both the dependencies and what changed when. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

Richer Context: As we expand coverage and integrate more signals, we continue to enrich the topology with additional endpoint-level details, protocol information, and network path context. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

And looking further ahead, we're excited about something bigger: Automated root cause analysis. Imagine an intelligent agent that continuously crawls the topology graph, correlates failures across dependencies, understands historical patterns, and surfaces likely root causes automatically. Service topology provides the knowledge graph foundation that makes this kind of intelligent automation possible. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### Why This Matters for Our Members

This might seem like infrastructure — plumbing that our members never see directly. But it matters immensely to their experience. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

When engineers can quickly understand dependencies and identify issues, incidents get resolved faster. When we can model blast radius before making changes, we avoid disruptions. When automated systems can query dependency information programmatically, we can build smarter, more resilient systems. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

All of this translates to what matters most: our members getting to watch their favorite films and series, seamlessly, whenever they want. Whether it's a weekend binge of a beloved show, a live sports event, or discovering something new through our recommendations tailored to their tastes — we want it to just work. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### What's Next in This Series

This is the first in a series of posts about building Service Topology at Netflix. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

In our next post, we'll pull back the curtain on the engineering challenges we faced at scale: How do you handle Kafka consumer lag when ingesting millions of flow logs per second? What happens when distributed processing meets garbage collection pauses? How do you debug reactive streams that stall under load? How do you manage hot nodes in a distributed system? We'll share the real problems we hit in production and the solutions we developed. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

In future posts, we'll explore the lessons we learned that apply to any distributed system at scale, and where we're heading next with time travel capabilities and Automated root cause analysis. ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

## 深度分析

### 多层图融合架构的核心洞察

Netflix 的 Service Topology 采用了与众不同的多图并行架构，而非试图用单一数据源构建全视图。这一设计选择的深层逻辑在于：不同数据源的信息密度和覆盖范围存在本质矛盾。eBPF 网络流提供的是完整但浅层的信息——能捕获所有通信但缺乏应用语义；IPC 指标提供的是深层但局部的信息——有丰富的应用上下文但依赖服务自报；分布式追踪提供的是行为级但抽样的信息——反映真实调用路径但无法覆盖低频路径。三图物理分离后各自优化，查询时并行穿透再融合结果规避了单一图数据库在混合负载下的性能困境。这种"分离-并行-融合"模式对于面临多源异构数据的工程团队具有普遍的借鉴意义。 ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### 中介层解析的三阶段工程价值

网络流日志到应用拓扑的关键转换在于"中介层解析"。Netflix 坦承这是一个未被充分重视的工程难题：原始网络流只记录跳跃（如 A→负载均衡→B），但用户需要的是应用级直连（A→B）。三阶段聚合 pipeline 的价值不止于数据清洗，更在于通过分层处理实现负载均衡——Stage 2 的解析逻辑天然支持将热点应用和中继设备的流量分散到不同处理单元，将 100 倍流量差异的处理负载分布在多个阶段。这一工程实践揭示了一个常见误区：许多团队在构建服务依赖图时直接使用原始网络流，导致代理层设备（负载均衡器、API 网关、NAT 网关）被错误地识别为依赖节点，引发误导性的爆炸半径计算。 ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### 实时拓扑的"活地图"属性对可观测性范式的冲击

传统可观测性工具（指标、日志、追踪）遵循的是"采样-存储-查询"的批处理思维，拓扑信息通常以静态配置文件或架构图的形式存在。Netflix 强调的"living map"概念将拓扑从静态文档转变为实时反映业务行为的动态图。这一转变对可观测性范式产生深远影响：故障排查的起点不再是症状搜索，而是拓扑上下文导航；根因分析不再需要从海量日志中回溯，而可以直接在调用链图中追溯；变更影响评估不再依赖人工查配置，而可以实时查询历史拓扑快照。时间旅行查询能力（time-window aggregation）的工程实现进一步证明，将拓扑数据以时间维度累积而非按时间切片离散存储，可以高效支持任意历史时间点的拓扑重建，同时控制存储成本。 ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### 可观测性数据源的互补性三角

文章提出了一个关键命题："no single source tells the complete story"。这一表述揭示了分布式系统可观测性中的一个根本性张力：覆盖度（completeness）、语义深度（semantic richness）和性能开销（performance overhead）构成不可能三角。任何单一数据源都无法同时满足三个维度。eBPF 牺牲语义深度换取覆盖度；IPC 指标牺牲覆盖度换取语义深度；分布式追踪在覆盖度和语义深度之间通过采样寻求平衡。Netflix 的解决方案本质上是承认了这一三角的存在，选择构建多源互补系统而非寻找银弹。这一认知对工程团队的启示是：可观测性建设的优先级应当是可组合性（composability），而非某单一数据源的极致优化。 ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### 自动化根因分析的知识图谱基础

文章展望了 Automated Root Cause Analysis（自动根因分析）的愿景，并将 Service Topology 定性为"知识图谱基础"。这一表述暗示了可观测性系统的演进方向：从被动查询工具到主动分析引擎的范式转变。知识图谱范式的关键价值在于支持多跳推理（multi-hop reasoning）——给定一个故障症状，可以通过拓扑图的遍历找到传播路径上的所有潜在根因；结合历史模式匹配，可以对相似故障的根因进行概率排序。这一愿景的实现依赖于三个前提：拓扑图的完整性（无遗漏依赖）、鲜活性（实时更新）和可查询性（亚秒级多跳遍历）。Netflix 的多层图架构在物理层面保障了这三个前提，为上层智能分析引擎提供了坚实的数据基础。 ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

## 实践启示

### 1. 以"三个问题"驱动可观测性建设

Netflix 从数千个工程师支持请求中提炼出的三个核心问题（依赖什么？影响多大？根因在哪？）应当成为任何分布式系统可观测性建设的需求起点。这意味着可观测性建设的优先级不是 instrument 所有服务，而是首先回答"我的服务在调用谁？谁在调用我？"这个拓扑问题。工程团队应当将依赖可视化能力作为 MVP（最小可行产品）的核心组件，而非等到系统"足够大"后才考虑。 ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### 2. 构建多源数据融合的工程习惯

单一数据源的可观测性系统必然存在盲区。工程团队应当培养多源数据融合的工程习惯：评估工具时不仅关注其数据质量，更关注其与其他数据源的互补性；构建可观测性 pipeline 时预留多源接入的扩展点；在故障排查流程中建立跨数据源交叉验证的机制。Netflix 的三层图架构虽然工程复杂度高，但其核心理念（不同数据源提供不同视角，融合后消除盲区）可以在更小规模系统中以简化形式落地。 ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### 3. 优先解决中介层解析问题

在构建服务依赖图时，代理层设备（负载均衡器、API 网关、Service Mesh sidecar）会产生大量"假依赖"边。这些边会导致：爆炸半径计算时包含不必要的中间组件、维护窗口评估时遗漏真实下游服务、故障传播路径中混入非业务组件。工程团队应当在数据 pipeline 早期阶段实现中介层解析逻辑，将网络跳跃转换为应用级直连。实现方式可以是配置驱动的已知中介列表（如已知的服务网格代理），也可以是通过流量模式学习自动识别中继设备。 ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### 4. 拓扑数据的时间维度设计

很多团队在设计可观测性存储时忽略了时间维度。Netflix 的时间旅行查询能力表明，拓扑数据的时间维度设计应当从一开始就纳入架构考量。关键决策包括：聚合窗口大小的选择（太细粒度则存储爆炸，太粗粒度则时序精度丧失）、历史数据保留策略（不同时间范围使用不同的采样率）、以及时间旅行查询的性能保障（提前预计算关键时间点的拓扑快照）。对于中等规模系统，建议至少保留最近 24 小时的高精度拓扑和最近 30 天的日级聚合拓扑。 ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]

### 5. gRPC API 的双重受众设计

Service Topology 同时服务于人类工程师（UI 探索）和自动化系统（程序化调用），这种双重受众设计值得借鉴。UI 层需要的是快速迭代和丰富交互；API 层需要的是稳定契约和高效批量查询。工程团队在设计可观测性基础设施时，应当为 API 层预留独立的演进路径，避免 UI 需求污染 API 契约。同时，API 层应当支持过滤（availability tier、business domain）、分页和图遍历等核心原语，使自动化系统可以在上层构建复杂的依赖分析逻辑。 ^[raw/articles/netflix-real-time-service-topology.md]
