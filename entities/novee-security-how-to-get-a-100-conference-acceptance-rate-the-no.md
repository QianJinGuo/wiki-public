# How to Get a 100% Conference Acceptance Rate, The Novee Way: A High-Severity CVE in Leading Call-for-Papers Software

## 深度分析

_A walkthrough of how Novee finds the type of chained exploit that SAST and DAST miss, and how to speed-run your next CFP cycle (kidding). A massive thank-you to the pretalx team and creator Tobias Kunze for their extraordinarily rapid and cooperative disclosure._ ^[raw/articles/novee-security-how-to-get-a-100-conference-acceptance-rate-the-no.md]

## What you need to know

*   The Novee Security research team disclosed a high-severity stored XSS – leading to **account takeover** – in **pretalx,** the open-source conference management platform used by a long list of technical events to run their CFPs and schedules.
*   Any registered user could plant HTML or JavaScript in the organizer-side search result dropdown, and have it execute in an organizer’s browser when the organizer’s typeahead query matched the record.
*   The moment a program chair typed a query that matched a malicious record, the payload executed in the organizer’s browser with the ability to call authenticated endpoints on the organizer’s behalf – including **the endpoint that accepts a submission and account takeover.**
*   The flaw was assigned **CVSS 8.7 (High)**: network attack vector, low complexity, low privileges required, user interaction required, scope changed, high impact to confidentiality and integrity. The flaw received CVE-2026-41241.
*   Fixed in pretalx v2026.1.0.

## The Setup

As a founding engineer and security researcher at Novee, my job is to think like an attacker – and to train Novee’s AI agents to do the same. ^[raw/articles/novee-security-how-to-get-a-100-conference-acceptance-rate-the-no.md]

When I discovered this particular exploit, however, I was doing something ordinary: preparing conference submissions. Different events, different review committees, different deadlines, but I noticed the same submission form kept appearing under different logos. ^[raw/articles/novee-security-how-to-get-a-100-conference-acceptance-rate-the-no.md]

Much of the technical conference world runs its CFPs on **pretalx**, an open-source platform behind everything from hacker camps to academic symposiums. From the outside, each event looks independent. Underneath, it is one codebase serving them all. ^[raw/articles/novee-security-how-to-get-a-100-conference-acceptance-rate-the-no.md]

That is the kind of pattern an attacker notices. If the workflow is shared, a flaw in it is not one bug – it is a systemic exposure. And if the flaw is the right shape, an autonomous agent can operationalize it across every instance, without direct participation from the attacker. ^[raw/articles/novee-security-how-to-get-a-100-conference-acceptance-rate-the-no.md]

Submitting to forty CFPs by hand is a project. Submitting to forty CFPs with an agent is a script. And if the underlying software has the right kind of flaw, you do not need to convince forty program committees of anything – you just need to convince one piece of JavaScript. ^[raw/articles/novee-security-how-to-get-a-100-conference-acceptance-rate-the-no.md]

## Inside the Vulnerability

**Pretalx** is not a carelessly built application. It ships a strict Content Security Policy: script-src ‘self’, no inline scripts allowed. The HTML5 spec adds another layer, <script> tags inserted via innerHTML do not execute. Even if you find an injection point, two independent defenses stand between you and JavaScript execution. ^[raw/articles/novee-security-how-to-get-a-100-conference-acceptance-rate-the-no.md]

The organizer search bar is that injection point. It renders results via innerHTML, and submission titles flow into the dropdown unsanitized. When an organizer types a query that matches a malicious record, the HTML renders. ^[raw/articles/novee-security-how-to-get-a-100-conference-acceptance-rate-the-no.md]

On paper, it should not matter. CSP and innerHTML’s script suppression should make this a cosmetic issue at worst. In practice, both layers of defense were bypassed without breaking either one: ^[raw/articles/novee-security-how-to-get-a-100-conference-acceptance-rate-the-no.md]

**The first defense is innerHTML’s script suppression.** The HTML5 spec says <script> tags inserted via innerHTML do not execute. But <iframe srcdoc> creates a fresh document parsing context, i.e. a new page inside the page. In that context, <script> executes normally. And because pretalx’s CSP has no frame-src directive, same-origin iframes are allowed by default. ^[raw/articles/novee-security-how-to-get-a-100-conference-acceptance-rate-the-no.md]

**The second defense is CSP**. script-src ‘self’ means only scripts served from the application’s own origin can run. An inline script would be blocked. But the script is not inline — it loads from the same origin via <script src=…>. CSP passes. ^[raw/articles/novee-security-how-to-get-a-100-conference-acceptance-rate-the-no.md]

The question is, where does a same-origin JavaScript file come from when the attacker has no server access? The answer is the CFP itself. **pretalx** lets speakers attach resources to their submissions, like slides, papers, supplementary materials. There is no file-type restriction. The attacker uploads a .js file as lecture materials, and the platform serves it from its own domain. ^[raw/articles/novee-security-how-to-get-a-100-conference-acceptance-rate-the-no.md]

The full payload fits in a submission title:^[raw/articles/novee-security-how-to-get-a-100-conference-acceptance-rate-the-no.md]


“`

<iframe srcdoc=”<script src=/media/…/payload.js></script>” style=display:none> ^[raw/articles/novee-security-how-to-get-a-100-conference-acceptance-rate-the-no.md]

“`

An organizer searches. The dropdown renders the title. The iframe loads silently. The script executes with full access to the parent page – the organizer’s authenticated session. From there: session hijack, data exfiltration, self-propagation. Zero clicks after the search query. Zero visual indication. ^[raw/articles/novee-security-how-to-get-a-100-conference-acceptance-rate-the-no.md]
