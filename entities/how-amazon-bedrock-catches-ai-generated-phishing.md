# How Amazon Bedrock catches AI-generated phishing

## Summary

AI-generated phishing emails represent a new class of cyber threat — grammatically perfect, contextually accurate, and personalized to the target using OSINT. Traditional rule-based filters that rely on detecting typos, generic salutations, or mismatched domains are ineffective against these attacks. Amazon Bedrock provides a behavioral analysis framework that uses foundation models combined with sender baseline tracking, contextual grounding, and Amazon Bedrock Guardrails to detect AI-generated phishing at the behavioral level. This creates a multi-stage analysis pipeline that evaluates word choice, communication style deviations, and contextual appropriateness of requests. ^[raw/articles/how-amazon-bedrock-catches-ai-generated-phishing.md]

## Key Points

- **Behavioral analysis over signature matching**: Detects phishing by analyzing HOW a message is written, not by pattern-matching known attack signatures
- **Multi-stage pipeline**: Input guardrails → prompt construction with context → AI-powered analysis → multi-factor risk scoring → classification and routing
- **Continuous feedback loop**: Confirmed phishing patterns and false positives feed back into the system, improving accuracy over time
- **Sender baseline tracking**: Profiles how employees normally write, establishing a reference point for detecting anomalous behavior
- **Three risk scores**: Content anomaly, behavioral deviation, and context alignment scores combine into a 0–100 risk assessment

## Deep Analysis

### 1. The paradigm shift: From surface indicators to behavioral detection

The evolution of phishing represents a fundamental shift in detection strategy. Traditional phishing relied on volume over precision: millions of poorly written emails with obvious red flags (typos, generic greetings, mismatched logos) meant that surface-level pattern matching was an effective defense (AI Security Paradigm). ^[raw/articles/how-amazon-bedrock-catches-ai-generated-phishing.md]

AI-generated phishing inverts this completely:
- **Grammar is no longer a signal**: Perfect grammar and professional formatting are now indicators of potential AI-generated attacks
- **Context is weaponized**: OSINT data from professional networks, corporate websites, and digital footprints enables personalized targeting
- **Adaptive conversations**: AI-generated phishing can adapt in real-time based on responses, shifting tone or adjusting details

This forces security systems to move from "what does the message look like?" to "does this message match how the sender actually communicates?" — a shift from signature detection to behavioral anomaly detection. ^[raw/articles/how-amazon-bedrock-catches-ai-generated-phishing.md]

### 2. The five-stage analysis pipeline

The Amazon Bedrock phishing detection framework implements a rigorous analysis pipeline that runs in milliseconds alongside existing email infrastructure: ^[raw/articles/how-amazon-bedrock-catches-ai-generated-phishing.md]

**Stage 1 — Input Guardrails**: Amazon Bedrock Guardrails screen for sensitive content (PII, offensive language) and flag items for manual review. Critically, guardrails must be calibrated carefully — overly restrictive settings can prevent the model from analyzing suspicious content that legitimately needs evaluation. ^[raw/articles/how-amazon-bedrock-catches-ai-generated-phishing.md]

**Stage 2 — Prompt Construction with Context**: The pipeline builds an analysis prompt combining email content, sender baseline patterns, organizational context, and known phishing examples from Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. This ensures the model evaluates the message against a full picture, not in isolation. ^[raw/articles/how-amazon-bedrock-catches-ai-generated-phishing.md]

**Stage 3 — AI-Powered Analysis**: The foundation model processes the email using the constructed prompt while guardrails maintain security boundaries. The model examines subtle inconsistencies in writing style and misaligned requests that rule-based systems would miss. ^[raw/articles/how-amazon-bedrock-catches-ai-generated-phishing.md]

**Stage 4 — Multi-Factor Risk Scoring**: Three weighted scores are calculated: ^[raw/articles/how-amazon-bedrock-catches-ai-generated-phishing.md]
- Content anomaly score: unusual phrasing, formatting, or embedded elements
- Behavioral deviation score: divergence from sender's established communication patterns
- Context alignment score: appropriateness of requests relative to organizational context

**Stage 5 — Classification and Routing**: Safe (<30) → deliver to inbox; Suspicious (30–70) → quarantine for review; Dangerous (≥70) → block and alert security team. ^[raw/articles/how-amazon-bedrock-catches-ai-generated-phishing.md]

### 3. The continuous feedback loop as a competitive moat

The most architecturally significant aspect of this system is the continuous feedback loop (AI Feedback Loop concept): ^[raw/articles/how-amazon-bedrock-catches-ai-generated-phishing.md]

1. **Analyze** — Foundation model evaluates emails using dynamic prompts built from accumulated intelligence
2. **Score** — Risk score 0–100 assigned, suspicious messages quarantined
3. **Review** — Security team classifies flagged messages as phishing or false positive
4. **Learn** — Classifications feed back into the system, updating example libraries and sender baselines
5. **Enhance** — New examples and patterns are incorporated into analysis prompts

This creates a **widening moat effect**: the more the system is used, the better it becomes. Early cycles require more hands-on review, but the investment compounds — confirmed threats and corrected false positives both improve future accuracy. Over time, the security team's attention shifts from sifting through noise to investigating genuinely suspicious messages. ^[raw/articles/how-amazon-bedrock-catches-ai-generated-phishing.md]

### 4. Guardrail calibration as a critical design challenge

A key insight from this framework is the non-trivial challenge of guardrail configuration for security analysis: ^[raw/articles/how-amazon-bedrock-catches-ai-generated-phishing.md]

- **Under-calibration risk**: Insufficient filtering could allow sensitive data exposure through model responses
- **Over-calibration risk**: Aggressive filtering can prevent the model from analyzing suspicious content that contains offensive language or unusual formatting — exactly the kind of content a social engineer might use to bypass filters
- **Contextual grounding**: Guardrails provide grounding checks that keep model responses factually anchored to the email content, reducing false positives caused by model hallucination

This tension between security and analytical capability is a recurring pattern in AI security applications. The optimal configuration requires careful calibration that balances protection against the need to analyze potentially dangerous content. ^[raw/articles/how-amazon-bedrock-catches-ai-generated-phishing.md]

### 5. Implications for enterprise security architecture

The Amazon Bedrock phishing detection framework has broader implications for enterprise security architecture: ^[raw/articles/how-amazon-bedrock-catches-ai-generated-phishing.md]

- **AI as an augmentation layer**: Rather than replacing existing email security infrastructure, this approach adds an AI-powered inspection layer that evaluates behavioral risk alongside traditional authentication checks
- **Feedback-driven improvement**: Static, signature-based detection is increasingly obsolete. Security tools must incorporate feedback loops that improve with use
- **Cross-functional requirements**: Effective deployment requires collaboration between security teams (who understand the threat landscape) and ML engineers (who configure the models and guardrails)
- **Scaling human expertise**: The feedback loop amplifies the impact of a small security team by encoding their classifications into automated detection logic

## Practical Insights

1. **Start with a simple sender baseline**: Begin by profiling top executives and finance team members — they are the most common impersonation targets and their communication patterns are often distinctive enough to make behavioral deviation detection effective
2. **Calibrate guardrails iteratively**: Start with moderately restrictive settings, monitor false positive rates, and adjust based on real-world feedback. The goal is to catch sophisticated attacks without overwhelming the security team with false alarms
3. **Invest in the feedback loop**: The system's long-term value comes from the continuous feedback loop. Design your operational workflow so that classifying flagged messages takes minimal effort — a single-click interface for "phishing" vs. "legitimate" is ideal
4. **Complement, don't replace**: Keep existing email security infrastructure (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) in place. The AI analysis layer runs alongside it as an enhancement, not a replacement
5. **Build organizational trust**: Educate employees about how the behavioral analysis works and why some legitimate messages may be quarantined. Transparency about the system's operation builds trust and reduces frustration with false positives
