## Technical Requirements for Edge AI Networking

**Determinism** — bounded latency, no packet loss under load. Edge AI workloads cannot tolerate best-effort delivery. ^[raw/articles/wi-fi-flies-higher-as-edge-ai-build-out-takes-root-semiengineering-2026.md]

**Reliability** — high MTBF required for industrial deployments (factories, robotics) where downtime costs are high. ^[raw/articles/wi-fi-flies-higher-as-edge-ai-build-out-takes-root-semiengineering-2026.md]

**Security** — hardware-rooted primitives: ^[raw/articles/wi-fi-flies-higher-as-edge-ai-build-out-takes-root-semiengineering-2026.md]
- **PSA Level 3** (Platform Security Architecture): secure boot, trusted firmware updates, device attestation
- **ARM TrustZone**: isolated execution for model weights, training data, inference streams
- Both are needed to protect edge AI model integrity and prevent adversarial inference attacks

## Market Dynamics

### Wi-Fi vs 5G/6G mmWave for Edge AI
- **Wi-Fi wins indoor**: factories, retail, robotics, warehouses — lower cost, easier deployment, existing infrastructure
- **5G/6G mmWave wins outdoor**: large venues, public spaces, vehicle-to-infrastructure, backhaul
- **Hybrid deployments** common: Wi-Fi for primary edge AI + 5G for failover / outdoor reach

### Three Emerging Use Cases
1. **Industrial robotics** — deterministic networking required for safety (e.g., collaborative robots in factories) ^[raw/articles/wi-fi-flies-higher-as-edge-ai-build-out-takes-root-semiengineering-2026.md]
2. **Defense** — edge AI for autonomous systems, surveillance, signal processing; PSA Level 3 security mandatory ^[raw/articles/wi-fi-flies-higher-as-edge-ai-build-out-takes-root-semiengineering-2026.md]
3. **Predictive maintenance** — sensor fusion + edge inference on factory equipment; Wi-Fi 7/8 carries vibration, audio, video streams ^[raw/articles/wi-fi-flies-higher-as-edge-ai-build-out-takes-root-semiengineering-2026.md]

## Vendor Ecosystem

- **Synaptics** — Wi-Fi 7/8 SoC + edge AI accelerators
- **Infineon** — industrial-grade Wi-Fi + security (OPTIGA Trust M, AURIX MCU)
- **Keysight Technologies** — test & measurement for Wi-Fi 7/8 compliance + edge AI validation

## 深度分析

### Determinism: 从 QoS 偏好升级为采购门槛

Wi-Fi's MAC was built for contention, where a retransmission delay is harmless. Edge AI breaks that premise: inference in a control loop (robot arm, inspection cell, sensor-fusion node) rides a deadline-bearing path where a late frame is a lost frame. The source treats determinism, low latency and reliability as first-class requirements rather than best-effort preferences ^[raw/articles/wi-fi-flies-higher-as-edge-ai-build-out-takes-root-semiengineering-2026.md:27], and for the buyer the requirement is binary — either the radio bounds latency under worst-case load, or the safety case cannot be signed. As a procurement criterion, determinism changes four things: scheduling must reserve airtime rather than compete for it (TWT service periods, trigger-based OFDMA uplink); redundancy must be structural rather than statistical (MLO straddles two radios, so a fade becomes a failover); admission control must exist so a model download cannot starve the control plane; and acceptance tests must measure p99/p999 latency, jitter and loss under contention instead of average throughput.

### 连接性分工: 室内 Wi-Fi 与室外 5G/6G 的结构性边界

Wi-Fi 7/8 wins indoor edge AI — factories, retail, warehouses, robotics cells — on cost and deployment physics rather than throughput: unlicensed spectrum, existing cabling and AP footprints, teams already running WLANs. 5G/6G mmWave wins where Wi-Fi is structurally weakest: outdoor coverage, wide-area mobility, backhaul ^[raw/articles/wi-fi-flies-higher-as-edge-ai-build-out-takes-root-semiengineering-2026.md:29]. Read as segmentation rather than a scoreboard, this makes hybrids the normal case — Wi-Fi as the deterministic domain inside the cell, cellular as failover and long-haul reach — and pushes the hard work into the seam, where two scheduling models, two failure modes and no shared clock make handover the hardest place to hold bounded latency. Hybrids therefore need dual-homed nodes, flow pinning and per-flow timeout budgets covering the crossing.

### Wi-Fi 7/8 能力集与 Edge AI 流量画像

Edge AI traffic is not consumer traffic. Inference streams are periodic and small-payload with a hard per-cycle deadline, so they want bounded jitter and scheduling guarantees rather than peak speed. Federated-learning rounds and model updates are the opposite — uplink-heavy, synchronized bulk transfers of gradients or weight deltas that look nothing like video. MLO therefore matters less as speed than as aggregation plus lossless failover, and 320 MHz plus 4K-QAM help mainly by shortening the airtime occupancy of those transfers, freeing the channel for the periodic traffic that carries deadlines ^[raw/articles/wi-fi-flies-higher-as-edge-ai-build-out-takes-root-semiengineering-2026.md:37-41].

### 硬件根信任: 当攻击者可以碰到设备

The real threat model is someone with the device in hand, a debug header and unlimited time. On physically accessible nodes — factory floors, defense gear, retail kiosks — software-only protection of weights, training data and inference streams fails by construction, because any check software performs can be traced, patched or skipped by whoever controls flash and boot ROM. That makes the source's insistence on hardware-rooted primitives defensible rather than vendor posturing ^[raw/articles/wi-fi-flies-higher-as-edge-ai-build-out-takes-root-semiengineering-2026.md:28]: a hardware root of trust anchors boot to an immutable key, attestation proves a node runs unmodified firmware, and isolated execution (TrustZone) keeps weights and keys beyond the reach of the rich OS. PSA Level 3 is the contractual form of that claim — auditable isolation against a defined attack budget — whereas "we encrypt the weights" is not verifiable from outside the vendor.

### 工作负载分化、证据边界与上游传导

The three adoption drivers demand materially different things. Industrial robotics is an MTBF problem: the fabric must survive years of vibration, heat and dust with downtime priced against production cost. Defense is a trust-chain and tamper-resistance problem: the assets are weights and inference outputs, so a captured node must yield nothing and be evictable from the fleet. Predictive maintenance is nearly the inverse — long-duration, low-rate sensing where the binding constraints are power, sensor density and months of unattended operation. One fabric, three service profiles: designing for the strictest everywhere over-builds, while one profile for all fails the strictest case.

Evidence discipline matters equally: the source is vendor-adjacent, quoting Synaptics, Infineon and Keysight with very few quantitative benchmarks ^[raw/articles/wi-fi-flies-higher-as-edge-ai-build-out-takes-root-semiengineering-2026.md:30-32], so architectural claims ("determinism requires reserved airtime," "weights need hardware isolation," "mmWave struggles indoors") are defensible from first principles, while market-share and "Wi-Fi is winning" statements are directional vendor assertions rather than measurements. The substrate is also an upstream constraint on everything above it: an edge inference server or agent runtime is only as predictable as the fabric carrying its inputs — the argument that recurs in [[concepts/agent-sandbox|Agent Sandbox]] and [[concepts/agent-security-architecture|Agent Security Architecture]], and the constraint that makes [[entities/nvidia-edge-first-llms-av-robotics|Edge-First LLMs for AV & Robotics]] and [[entities/physical-ai-industrial-deployment-jiangxing-multi-embodiment|Physical AI Industrial Deployment]] substrate-bound.

## 实践启示

1. **Measure latency tails, not averages.** Require p99/p999 latency, jitter and loss-under-contention measured while the channel carries bulk traffic; an idle-channel benchmark proves nothing about a production cell. Treat vendor targets (sub-5 ms Wi-Fi 7, sub-2 ms Wi-Fi 8 class) as a starting line, then validate on the silicon you intend to ship ([[entities/amazon-sagemaker-qualcomm-ai-hub-edge-npu-deployment|SageMaker + Qualcomm AI Hub Edge NPU Deployment]]).
2. **Engineer for reserved airtime and structural redundancy.** Enable TWT scheduled service, trigger-based OFDMA uplink and MLO where silicon supports it, and keep admission control so model updates cannot starve a control loop; the model side follows the same discipline as [[concepts/inference-optimization|Inference Optimization]].
3. **Segment the fabric deliberately and own the seam.** Assign each workload to an indoor deterministic Wi-Fi domain, a cellular failover path or a backhaul link, then specify how flows cross — dual-homed nodes, flow pinning, per-flow timeout and handover budget. The boundary, not either radio, is where determinism usually dies.
4. **Assume the node will be captured.** Make hardware-backed secure boot, attestation and isolated execution a procurement gate, and read PSA Level 3 as auditable evidence rather than marketing copy, since software-only weight protection does not survive physical access ([[concepts/agent-security-threat-models|Agent Security Threat Models]]).
5. **Profile traffic before choosing radios.** Measure uplink duty cycle, burstiness and deadlines per workload — robotics reads as periodic small frames, federated learning as synchronized bulk upload, predictive maintenance as long low-rate sensing — and size buffering from that profile, not from consumer throughput numbers.
6. **Label every claim by evidence class.** Tag vendor assertions (market share, "Wi-Fi is winning," roadmap dates) as directional and architectural deductions (reserved airtime, hardware isolation, mmWave indoor limits) as constraints; connectivity is an upstream dependency of the agent stack, since no harness or sandbox can outrun the predictability of the network beneath it ([[concepts/multi-agent-context-isolation|Multi-Agent Context Isolation]]).
