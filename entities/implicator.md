## Google Open-Sources a Knowledge Format and Wires It Into Its Catalog

Google's Open Knowledge Format makes AI-agent knowledge a free, vendor-neutral markdown standard. The same day it shipped, Google wired the format into the Knowledge Catalog it charges to run, and the spec leaves the paid serving layer out of scope. Openness, it turns out, is the strategy. ^[raw/articles/implicator.md]

Google Cloud [published a specification on June 12](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-the-open-knowledge-format-can-improve-data-sharing?ref=implicator.ai) that represents the context AI agents need as a directory of plain markdown files, and the same day updated its Knowledge Catalog product to read that format and serve it to agents. The Open Knowledge Format, written by Google Cloud tech leads Sam McVeety and Amir Hormati, runs 451 lines and demands exactly one field of every document. Hormati described it on LinkedIn as "a format, not a platform." ^[raw/articles/implicator.md]

OKF gives away the part that was never scarce, a file any text editor can open, and points the demand that creates toward the part Google sells, the layer that stores the knowledge, serves it to agents, and controls who may see it. Openness is the mechanism, because a free, portable format turns the knowledge layer into a commodity and routes demand toward the catalog, gateway, and compute Google does not give away. Google's blog frames it differently, saying a knowledge format's value "comes from how many parties speak it, not from who owns it." ^[raw/articles/implicator.md]

Key Takeaways ^[raw/articles/implicator.md]

*   Google Cloud published the Open Knowledge Format on June 12, representing AI-agent knowledge as a directory of plain markdown files with one required field.
*   The same day, Google updated its Knowledge Catalog to ingest OKF and serve it to agents, the paid layer the spec leaves out of scope.
*   OKF formalizes Andrej Karpathy's 'LLM wiki' pattern, already spread through AGENTS.md files used by more than 60,000 open-source projects.
*   Every sample bundle was Google-built; whether vendors like Atlan, Alation, or Collate adopt it decides whether OKF becomes a standard.

## What the spec leaves out

The specification is precise about its limits. In its opening section, [OKF lists as non-goals](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/tree/main/okf?ref=implicator.ai) "prescribing storage, serving, or query infrastructure" and replacing domain schemas such as Avro, Protobuf, or OpenAPI, which it says it references rather than subsumes. The document runs 451 lines and about 15 kilobytes, and requires a single frontmat ^[raw/articles/implicator.md]
