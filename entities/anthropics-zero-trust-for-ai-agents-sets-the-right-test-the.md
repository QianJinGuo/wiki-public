## 核心要点

1. **Anthropic's policy paper on AI agent security** — Anthropic published a position paper advocating Zero Trust architecture for AI agents: every tool call should be authenticated, authorized, and audited independently, not relying on session-based trust. ^[raw/articles/anthropics-zero-trust-for-ai-agents-sets-the-right-test-the.md]
2. **The bearer token problem** — The author argues that long-lived bearer tokens (OAuth access tokens, API keys) are fundamentally incompatible with agentic AI. Agents accumulate tokens across services; if one token is compromised, the attacker has the agent's full delegated authority. The paper calls for short-lived, scoped, refresh-able credentials. ^[raw/articles/anthropics-zero-trust-for-ai-agents-sets-the-right-test-the.md]
3. **The test the bearer token fails** — A Zero Trust agent should NOT be able to perform an action it wasn't specifically authorized for in the current scope, even with a valid token. Current bearer token models fail this test: a valid `repo:read` token can sometimes be escalated to `repo:write` via confused deputy attacks. ^[raw/articles/anthropics-zero-trust-for-ai-agents-sets-the-right-test-the.md]
4. **Practical recommendation: per-action credential injection** — Instead of giving an agent a token at session start, the runtime should fetch a fresh, narrowly-scoped credential for each tool call, ideally with user-in-the-loop confirmation for high-risk actions (delete, send-money, modify-permissions). ^[raw/articles/anthropics-zero-trust-for-ai-agents-sets-the-right-test-the.md]
