# Simplify model selection in Amazon Bedrock with the open source Model Profiler

Generative AI adoption is accelerating across industries, and [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) provides a managed service for building production-ready AI applications. With access to more than 100 foundation models from providers such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta, Mistral AI, Cohere, and Amazon, teams have the flexibility to choose the right model for each use case.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:13-15]

But choice comes with complexity. Comparing models across capabilities, pricing, regional availability, context window limits and throughput isn't straightforward. That information is scattered across console pages, documentation, and regional API calls. For organizations evaluating models for new workloads, optimizing cost and performance, or migrating from other AI systems, this fragmented discovery process slows experimentation and delays production decisions.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:15-17]

The [Amazon Bedrock Model Profiler](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-bedrock-migration-and-modernization-tools/tree/main/bedrock-model-profiler) addresses this gap. This open source tool aggregates model metadata from multiple AWS APIs and external sources into a single, searchable interface. With advanced filtering, side-by-side comparisons, and detailed model cards, teams can explore the full Amazon Bedrock catalog and make informed, data-driven decisions by easing the manual search effort across various documents and model cards.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:17-19]

## Solution Overview

The Model Profiler is a web application that lets you browse, filter, and compare every foundation model available on Amazon Bedrock in one place. Instead of navigating multiple console pages and documentation sites, you get a single interface with model cards, side-by-side comparisons, regional availability maps, and pricing breakdowns updated daily.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:23-25]

Behind the interface, a fully automated serverless pipeline collects and processes data from seven distinct sources: five AWS APIs and two public URLs. This keeps the catalog accurate without manual intervention.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:27-28]

### Data Sources

| Source | Type | Auth | Data Collected |
|--------|------|------|---------------|
| Amazon Bedrock ListFoundationModels API | AWS API | IAM (Sigv4) | Model specifications, capabilities, modalities, regional availability across 33 regions |
| AWS Price List API | AWS API | IAM (Sigv4) | On-demand, batch, and reserved-tier pricing across three service codes |
| AWS Service Quotas API | AWS API | IAM (Sigv4) | Tokens-per-minute (TPM) limits, requests-per-minute (RPM) quotas, throughput constraints |
| Amazon Bedrock ListInferenceProfiles API | AWS API | IAM (Sigv4) | Cross-region inference configurations and geographic scopes |
| Amazon Bedrock Mantle API | AWS API | IAM (Sigv4) | Mantle inference availability across regions |
| LiteLLM Model Database | Public URL | None | Token specifications: context window sizes, max output tokens |
| AWS Documentation | Public URL | None | Model lifecycle status (active, legacy, end-of-life) |

### Data Pipeline Architecture

The Model Profiler runs a fully automated data pipeline orchestrated by AWS Step Functions. Seventeen AWS Lambda functions process data across four phases, using inter-Lambda S3 caching to reduce API calls from approximately 480 to 29 per execution — a 97% cache hit rate. A self-healing agentic system powered by Amazon Bedrock detects data gaps and automatically applies safe configuration fixes. The entire pipeline completes in 8–12 minutes and runs daily at 6 AM UTC.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:43-45]

**Pipeline phases**:^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md]

- **Phase 0 — Initialization**: Dynamically discovers AWS regions supporting Bedrock, initializes execution context, and synchronizes backend-frontend configuration.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:49-49]
- **Phase 1 — Parallel Collection**: Three branches run simultaneously — Pricing (AWS Price List API across three service codes), Models (ListFoundationModels fanned out across regions), and Quotas (TPM/RPM service limits).^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:53-53]
- **Phase 2 — Parallel Enrichment**: Six enrichment steps run concurrently — linking pricing to models, computing regional availability, determining cross-region inference support, fetching context windows, probing Mantle API, and determining lifecycle status.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:57-57]
- **Phase 3 — Aggregation and Intelligence**: Merges enrichment data into two production-ready JSON files (bedrock_models.json and bedrock_pricing.json), served through CloudFront. A gap detection system scans for seven types of data quality issues, with a self-healing agent automatically applying safe fixes.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:61-63]

### Key Features

1. **Model Explorer**: Browse 120+ foundation models in a searchable, filterable interface. Filter by provider (18+ providers), capabilities (vision, code generation, function calling, embeddings), modalities, region, and lifecycle status. Supports both card view (visual browsing) and table view (dense comparison).^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:77-85]
2. **Model Comparison**: Compare up to 25 models simultaneously across pricing, regional availability, specifications (context windows, max output tokens, supported features), and capabilities matrix.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:91-96]
3. **Regional Availability Matrix**: Comprehensive model-by-region view across all 33 Bedrock-enabled regions, grouped by geographic area (NAMER, EMEA, APAC, LATAM).

## Deep Analysis

### The Model Selection Problem: Fragmentation as a Hidden Cost

The Model Profiler addresses a pervasive but often underestimated challenge in enterprise AI adoption: **model discovery fragmentation**. With 120+ models across 18+ providers, each with different pricing tiers, regional availability, context windows, and latency profiles, the manual effort to find the right model for a specific workload is substantial.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md]


The blog post cites realistic scenarios where manual model evaluation took 6-8 hours per workload, and the tool reduced this to 25-45 minutes. This 10x reduction in evaluation time has direct business implications: faster time-to-production for AI features, more thorough evaluation (teams can compare more candidates in less time), and reduced risk of suboptimal model selection due to evaluation shortcuts.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:117-129]

### Architectural Excellence: Serverless Data Pipeline Design

The data pipeline architecture demonstrates several production engineering best practices:^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md]


1. **Cache-Optimized Multi-Phase Pipeline**: The 97% cache hit rate (480→29 API calls) is achieved through inter-Lambda S3 caching, where Phase 1 writes raw data to S3 and Phase 2 enrichment reads from cache rather than re-calling APIs. This design minimizes API costs and avoids rate limiting.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:43-43]
2. **Self-Healing Agentic System**: An Amazon Bedrock-powered agent automatically detects data quality gaps and applies safe fixes. If issues exceed configured thresholds, suggestions that don't meet safety criteria are logged for manual review rather than auto-applied. This balances automation with risk management.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:63-63]
3. **Dynamic Region Discovery**: No hardcoded region list — the pipeline discovers Bedrock-enabled regions dynamically at initialization, so newly launched regions are picked up automatically without code changes.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:49-49]
4. **Unified Local/Production Codebase**: The local collector imports the same transformation functions as the Lambda code, maintaining identical output whether running locally or in production. This significantly reduces the "works on my machine" risk.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:69-69]

### Business Impact: Real-World Use Cases

The blog post presents three fictional but realistic use cases that illustrate the tool's value:^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md]


**Compliance-aligned model selection** (Octank Financial Services): Needed vision-capable models restricted to EU regions for data residency. Manual: 6-8 hours. With profiler: 25 minutes. Discovered 18% cost savings in eu-west-1 vs. eu-central-1 and found a newer model with larger context window that eliminated the need to split documents.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:117-121]

**Provider migration** (Octank Health): Migrating from a third-party AI provider to Bedrock required 128K+ context, low latency, and 3+ US regions for redundancy. Manual: extensive cross-referencing. With profiler: 45 minutes. Chose a model with 200K context window (upgrade from 128K) at 15% lower cost.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:125-129]

**Multi-region deployment planning** (Octank Media): Expanding recommendation engine from US to Europe and APAC needed availability and quota confirmation. Analysis: 20 minutes vs. previously requiring CLI queries per region. Identified Tokyo as a potential throughput bottleneck requiring a quota increase request before launch.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md:133-137]

### Position in the AWS AI Tooling Ecosystem

The Model Profiler fills a gap between AWS's infrastructure-level offerings (Bedrock API, pricing API) and application-level AI development tools. It is analogous to tools like LiteLLM (model routing/comparison) and LangSmith (observability), but specifically focused on the **pre-deployment model evaluation and selection** phase. Its open-source nature and MIT-0 license make it suitable for teams that want to customize or extend the catalog.^[raw/articles/simplify-model-selection-in-amazon-bedrock-with-the-open-source-model-profiler.md]


## Practical Insights

1. **Model discovery fragmentation is a real cost center in enterprise AI**: Teams spend disproportionate time on manual cross-referencing rather than model evaluation. Investing in automated discovery tools like the Model Profiler can reduce evaluation time by 10x and simultaneously improve evaluation thoroughness.

2. **Cache-optimized pipeline design is essential for multi-source data aggregation**: The 97% cache hit rate demonstrates that intelligent pipeline design (inter-Lambda S3 caching) can dramatically reduce API costs and runtime. This pattern is broadly applicable to any multi-source data aggregation task.

3. **Self-healing infrastructure is pragmatic for data-quality-critical pipelines**: The gap detection + auto-fix system balances automation with safety (fixes below threshold auto-applied, risky suggestions logged). This "auto-fix with manual override" pattern is recommended for any automated pipeline where data quality is critical.

4. **Pricing and quota information should drive model selection, not just capabilities**: The profiler's integration of pricing, TPM/RPM quotas, and lifecycle status alongside capabilities addresses a common failure mode — teams select a model based on benchmarks, only to discover it's unavailable in their target region or too expensive at scale.

5. **The tool reveals a pattern worth replicating for other AI platforms**: Any AI platform with multiple models could benefit from a similar open-source profiler. This "model marketplace browser" pattern could become a standard utility for multi-model platforms.
