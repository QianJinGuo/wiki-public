## 核心要点



_(this post itself is LLM slop, but it tastes alright)_ ^[raw/articles/sunilpai.md]

tl;dr - put a durable buffer between your agent and the LLM provider. the provider connection now outlives your process, so a deploy in the middle of a stream doesn’t cost you the tokens you already paid for. and the same buffer that lets a disconnected browser catch back up is the thing that recovers a crashed turn. one log, two readers. ^[raw/articles/sunilpai.md]

* * *

I’ve spent the last few weeks stuck on one question: what happens to an agent when the process running it dies in the middle of a turn? ^[raw/articles/sunilpai.md]

it goes deep fast. tool calls that may or may not have fired. sub-agents. half-written streams waiting on a human. I’m writing all of that up separately (durable agent loops, coming soon). but one piece of it is small and self-contained enough to pull out on its own: ^[raw/articles/sunilpai.md]

**when your process dies mid-inference, you don’t just lose your place. you lose money.**

## the problem that’s easy to miss

your agent opens a streaming request to a model, and the model starts generating. you’re billed for those output tokens the moment they’re generated. then your process gets replaced. maybe a deploy, maybe an eviction, maybe an OOM. ^[raw/articles/sunilpai.md]

the usual reassurance is “don’t worry, the state is durable.” and sure, your conversation history survived. but the _in-flight HTTP request to the provider_ did not. it lived in the memory of the process that just died. so when you recover, your only option is to **make the call again**. you pay for those output tokens a second time. ^[raw/articles/sunilpai.md]

now make it an agent. a real one does multiple tool calls in a single turn: ^[raw/articles/sunilpai.md]

```
user message
  → stream some text
  → tool call → tool result
  → stream more text
  → tool call → tool result
  → stream the answer
```

every interruption throws away _all_ the output tokens generated so far in that turn. and it scales with the model you actually want to use: output runs $30 per million tokens on `gpt-5.5` versus $2 on `gpt-5.5-mini`, so a flagship retry burns ~15x what a mini one does. the better the model, the more it hurts. deploys happen constantly, evictions happen constantly, and each one that lands on a live stream is money straight out the window. ^[raw/articles/sunilpai.md]

the happy path hides it. you only see it when you start counting tokens after an incident and the numbers don’t add up. ^[raw/articles/sunilpai.md]

## the move: stop tying the request to the process

the reason a crash wastes tokens is that the provider connection lives _inside the thing that crashed_. so move it out. ^[raw/articles/sunilpai.md]

put a buffer between the agent and the provider, and make it a **separate deployment**: its own Worker, its own Durable Object. ^[raw/articles/sunilpai.md]

when a request comes in, the buffer does three things in order. it resets its state for a fresh stream. it kicks off a background task that drains the provider connection into SQLite. and it immed ^[raw/articles/sunilpai.md]
