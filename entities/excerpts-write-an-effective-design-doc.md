# How to Write an Effective Software Design Document

> **来源**: [How to Write an Effective Software Design Document](https://refactoringenglish.com/excerpts/write-an-effective-design-doc/)



A good design doc can save you years of development time. Writing a design doc forces you to think through important decisions before you waste time on the wrong implementation or paint yourself into a corner. It’s also the best way to coordinate design decisions among teammates and partner teams. ^[raw/articles/excerpts-write-an-effective-design-doc.md]

I’ve written design docs as a developer at Google, Microsoft, and within [my own companies](https://mtlynch.io/projects/). The specifics vary, but the underlying principles remain the same. A design doc should articulate the hard problems you’re solving and help your teammates give you feedback. ^[raw/articles/excerpts-write-an-effective-design-doc.md]

Below, I share my approach to creating effective design docs and explain what belongs in a design doc and what does not. ^[raw/articles/excerpts-write-an-effective-design-doc.md]

## An example design doc[🔗](http://refactoringenglish.com/excerpts/write-an-effective-design-doc/#an-example-design-doc)

The most common question I get about design docs is where to find a good one. I’ve never seen a public design doc that I consider high-quality. All of mine are hidden away at the companies that paid me to write them. ^[raw/articles/excerpts-write-an-effective-design-doc.md]

So, I wrote [a design doc from scratch](https://refactoringenglish.com/excerpts/write-an-effective-design-doc/little-moments-design-doc/) based on the principles I’m sharing here. It lays out the design for [a real web app I’m building](https://codeberg.org/mtlynch/little-moments). ^[raw/articles/excerpts-write-an-effective-design-doc.md]

[Video 3](https://refactoringenglish.com/excerpts/write-an-effective-design-doc/little-moments-demo.mp4) ^[raw/articles/excerpts-write-an-effective-design-doc.md]
I created the design doc before writing any code, and I’m adhering to the design [as I implement the app](https://codeberg.org/mtlynch/little-moments#status). ^[raw/articles/excerpts-write-an-effective-design-doc.md]

*   [Little Moments Design Doc](https://refactoringenglish.com/excerpts/write-an-effective-design-doc/little-moments-design-doc/)

The design is more exhaustive than what I’d normally write for a solo hobby project, but this is roughly the length and depth of a design doc I’d create if I were coordinating work with other people on a professional project. ^[raw/articles/excerpts-write-an-effective-design-doc.md]

## When should you write a design doc?[🔗](http://refactoringenglish.com/excerpts/write-an-effective-design-doc/#when-should-you-write-a-design-doc)

The more complex or risky the project, the more valuable it is to write a design doc. ^[raw/articles/excerpts-write-an-effective-design-doc.md]

Consider these questions:

*   Will multiple people coordinate work to implement the design?
*   Will the project take more than three months of full-time dev work?
*   Will the implementation run in production for several years?
