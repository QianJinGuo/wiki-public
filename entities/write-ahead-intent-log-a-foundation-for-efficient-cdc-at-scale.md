Vinay Chella and Akshat Goel discuss the challenges of running traditional CDC across heterogeneous databases during peak order traffic. They explain how Debezium hit limits under high load and share how they built Write-Ahead Intent Log (WAIL) - a custom architecture that utilizes a dumb producer proxy and a smart consumer pattern to cleanly separate the intent from the state payload. ^[raw/articles/write-ahead-intent-log-a-foundation-for-efficient-cdc-at-scale.md]

Vinay Chella is an Engineering Leader at DoorDash, where he leads the Storage and Streaming Infrastructure organization that powers mission-critical systems across the marketplace. Akshat Goel is a Staff Software Engineer at DoorDash, where he builds the Storage Access Platform, a unified abstraction layer powering all online data stores. ^[raw/articles/write-ahead-intent-log-a-foundation-for-efficient-cdc-at-scale.md]

Software is changing the world. QCon San Francisco empowers software development by facilitating the spread of knowledge and innovation in the developer community. A practitioner-driven conference, QCon is designed for technical team leads, architects, engineering directors, and project managers who influence innovation in their teams. ^[raw/articles/write-ahead-intent-log-a-foundation-for-efficient-cdc-at-scale.md]
