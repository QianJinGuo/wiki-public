# Client-Side Load Balancing at a Million Requests Per Second

Zalando 在百万 RPS 级别的客户端负载均衡工程实践，从服务发现到连接管理的完整技术栈。^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]


## 核心内容

Our busiest API ran its high-volume internal traffic through the cluster's shared edge ingress load balancer. For years we could never be sure whether a latency spike came from our own code or from reusing that shared edge router internally.^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]


In a [previous post](https://engineering.zalando.com/posts/2025/03/event-driven-to-api.html), we described how we built Zalando's Product Read API (PRAPI), serving millions of requests per second with single-digit-millisecond latency across 25 European markets. Every product page, search result, and checkout depends on it. A brief degradation has measurable impact on sales, resulting in high performance and availability requirements. The low latency is achieved through consistent-hash routing: [Skipper](https://github.com/zalando/skipper), the cluster's edge load balancer, routes the same product ID to the same pod(s), helping to leverage pod-local caches in the underlying application. The routing infrastructure for this API matters.^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]


On launch, Skipper handled both edge routing and the internal traffic between our batching and single-get components. It was always my intention that client-side load balancing (CSLB) would replace the latter, and I had hoped it would be a fast-follow. But Skipper was fast, adding only a couple of hundred microseconds to each request, and the team was understandably reluctant to introduce significant change to a working system. Over the years, as incidents accumulated where the root cause was never quite clear (Skipper, or PRAPI?), it became harder to ignore the structural problem. For a single batch-of-100 request, PRAPI had a 100x exposure to Skipper. When Skipper sneezed, PRAPI got the flu.^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]


Some of those incidents, it would later turn out, were neither Skipper nor PRAPI. But we had no way to see that until we owned the routing decision, and the detailed logs that came with it.^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]


## Skipper and the Fan-Out Problem

Skipper is Zalando's open-source Kubernetes ingress controller and HTTP router. It handles edge load balancing brilliantly: consistent-hash routing, bounded load protection, fade-in for new pods. We contributed key features to Skipper ourselves, including [minimising cache loss during scaling](https://github.com/zalando/skipper/issues/1712) and [preventing overload from hyped products](https://github.com/zalando/skipper/issues/1769). We still use Skipper for all single-product GET requests today.^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]


The problem was our batch endpoint. PRAPI's product-sets component unpacks a single batch request into up to 100 parallel downstream calls to individual products pods. Each of those 100 calls transits Skipper. Skipper adds only a couple of hundred microseconds per hop, but a batch waits on up to a hundred of those hops at once, so its latency tracks the slowest of the hundred, not the typical one. And Skipper is shared infrastructure: we run on the same fleet as the rest of our cluster, on a global configuration we inherit rather than set.^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]


![Image 2: Product-sets fan-out diagram](https://img01.ztat.net/engineering-blog/posts/2026/06/images/cslb-consistent-hash-load-balancing-before.png?imwidth=1320#center)^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]


Product-sets fan-out through the ingress load balancer^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]


During incidents, we could never be certain whether latency spikes originated in Skipper or in our own code. It sat in the hot path of every request, we did not run it, and we could not cleanly separate its behaviour from ours. Even when Skipper was fast, that shared fate was the problem.^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]


We decided that for high fan-out internal traffic, the routing decision should live inside the calling process itself. Edge traffic, where Skipper excels, should stay exactly where it is. We were not replacing Skipper; we were graduating the internal fan-out path to a client-side load balancer that runs inside the process.^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]

Product-sets routing directly to products pods^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]


## Building the Same Hash Ring

We did not need client-side balancing in the abstract, we needed the exact same ring as Skipper, in our own process. The most critical constraint was therefore hash parity. During migration, both Skipper and our client-side load balancer would route requests to the same pool of products pods. If the hash rings disagreed, a product that Skipper routes to pod A might be routed to pod B by our library. That would split caches and double DynamoDB load, exactly the opposite of what we wanted.^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]


We implemented the same algorithm Skipper uses: [xxHash64](https://github.com/zalando/skipper/blob/master/loadbalancer/algorithm.go) on a configurable virtual-node ring. Each endpoint URL is placed at 100 positions on a 64-bit hash ring, matching Skipper's default. When a request comes in, the product ID is hashed and a binary search on the ring finds the nearest endpoint clockwise.^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]


This means that adding or removing an endpoint remaps only about 1/N of keys, minimising cache churn. And because both Skipper and our library use the same hash function and the same number of virtual nodes, they produce identical rings for the same set of pods. A bank of unit tests pins this down: they assert our ring places the same keys on the same endpoints as Skipper's algorithm for any pod set, and run on every build, so a later change cannot silently drift from Skipper. We confirmed it held in production too, during the canary: cache hit ratios stayed identical on both paths.^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]


We wrote it as a standalone, framework-free JVM module with the long-term intention of lifting it out of this service. Its only real dependency is a small zero-allocation hashing library, for the xxHash64 that matches Skipper; everything else, the ring, the occupancy accounting, the bounded-load ^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md]


## 深度分析

### 共享基础设施的"扇出放大"问题

Zalando 的案例揭示了一个普遍性架构问题：当高扇出请求经过共享基础设施时，延迟不是由典型响应时间决定，而是由最慢的那个扇出请求决定。对于 PRAPI 的 batch-of-100 请求，单次 Skipper 跳转仅增加数百微秒延迟，但 100 个并行跳转的累积延迟由 P99 决定而非 P50。^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md] 这种"扇出放大效应"使得共享基础设施的尾部延迟问题在高扇出场景中被指数级放大。

### 客户端负载均衡的哈希一致性挑战

从 Skipper 迁移到 CSLB 最关键的技术约束是**哈希环一致性**——两个系统必须对同一组 pod 产生完全相同的路由决策。^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md] Zalando 使用相同的 xxHash64 算法和相同数量的虚拟节点（100 个）来确保一致性，并通过单元测试固化这一约束。这种"算法对等"迁移模式在分布式系统中非常有价值——它允许渐进式迁移而不需要大爆炸切换。

### 从"共享命运"到"可观测性"的架构收益

迁移到 CSLB 的收益不仅是延迟改善，更重要的是**故障隔离和可观测性**。当延迟异常发生时，团队可以立即确定是路由层还是应用层的问题，而非在 Skipper 和 PRAPI 之间互相排查。^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md] 这种"拥有路由决策权"带来的诊断能力提升，往往比直接的性能收益更具长期价值。

### 边缘流量与内部流量的分层治理

Zalando 的架构决策体现了清晰的分层治理原则：边缘流量继续使用 Skipper（擅长 consistent-hash routing、bounded load protection、fade-in），内部高扇出流量迁移到 CSLB。^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md] 这不是对 Skipper 的否定，而是对不同流量特征采用不同路由策略的工程判断。

### 框架无关的 JVM 模块设计

Zalando 将 CSLB 实现为独立的、无框架依赖的 JVM 模块，唯一依赖是一个零分配哈希库。^[raw/articles/zalando-client-side-load-balancing-million-rps.md] 这种设计使得模块可以在不同服务间复用，避免了框架耦合带来的版本锁定问题。对于基础设施组件，"最小依赖"原则是长期可维护性的关键。

## 实践启示

1. **高扇出请求不应经过共享负载均衡器**：当请求扇出比 >10 时，应考虑客户端负载均衡，避免共享基础设施的尾部延迟被扇出放大。
2. **迁移时保持算法一致性**：使用相同的哈希函数和虚拟节点数量确保新旧系统路由决策一致，通过单元测试固化这一约束，支持渐进式迁移。
3. **CSLB 的核心价值是可观测性而非延迟**：拥有路由决策权使得故障诊断从"互相排查"变为"精确定位"，这在生产 incident 中的价值远超微秒级延迟改善。
4. **边缘流量和内部流量应使用不同路由策略**：边缘流量需要全局负载均衡、安全防护、协议转换等能力，内部流量更关注延迟和故障隔离。
5. **基础设施组件应设计为框架无关**：最小依赖、独立模块的设计使得组件可以在多个服务间复用，避免框架版本锁定。
