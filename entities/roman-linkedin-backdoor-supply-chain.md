## 核心要点

- **来源**: https://roman.pt/posts/linkedin-backdoor/
- **评分**: v=8, c=8, v×c=64, stars=4
- **评估理由**: Well-written first-person security case study of a real social engineering / supply chain attack via LinkedIn. Clearly structured narrative (setup, backdoor, trigger mechanism, impersonation, takeaways) with concrete technical details: npm `prepare` lifecycle script auto-executing after `npm install

Last week, I got a LinkedIn message from a recruiter at a small crypto startup. We exchanged a few messages over a couple of days, she described a broken proof-of-concept they needed a lead engineer for, and then sent me a public GitHub repo to review. Specifically, she asked me to “check out the deprecated Node modules issue.” ^[raw/articles/roman-linkedin-backdoor-supply-chain.md]

It’s not uncommon to ask for a review of an existing codebase, but something felt off and raised an alarm in my head, so I decided to get a bit extra paranoid. ^[raw/articles/roman-linkedin-backdoor-supply-chain.md]

Instead of cloning and installing dependencies, I spun up a throwaway VPS on Hetzner, cloned the repo there, and pointed [Pi](https://pi.dev/) at it in read-only mode, with only file-reading tools enabled: ^[raw/articles/roman-linkedin-backdoor-supply-chain.md]

```
pi --tools read,grep,find,ls
```

I asked the agent to review the codebase and flag anything suspicious. It stopped almost immediately at `app/test/index.js`. ^[raw/articles/roman-linkedin-backdoor-supply-chain.md]

## The backdoor

The repo felt like a React frontend with a Node backend. The trap was in `app/test/index.js`, about 250 lines disguised as a test suite. In ^[raw/articles/roman-linkedin-backdoor-supply-chain.md]
