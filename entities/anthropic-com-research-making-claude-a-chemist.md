# Making Claude a chemist

## 深度分析

### 1. Claude 作为化学家：专业领域 AI 的里程碑
Anthropic 的研究让 Claude 在化学领域达到专家水平——不是通用 AI 的泛化能力，而是通过专业训练和评估实现的领域专精。 ^[raw/articles/anthropic-com-research-making-claude-a-chemist.md]

### 2. 领域 AI vs 通用 AI 的路线分歧
领域专精 AI（化学家 Claude、医疗 GPT）和通用 AI（GPT-5、Claude Opus）是两条不同路线——领域 AI 更快落地但适用范围窄，通用 AI 适用范围广但领域精度低。 ^[raw/articles/anthropic-com-research-making-claude-a-chemist.md]

### 3. 评估标准需要领域定制
化学领域的 AI 评估需要领域专家设计的评估集——通用 benchmark（MMLU、GSM8K）无法充分衡量化学推理能力。 ^[raw/articles/anthropic-com-research-making-claude-a-chemist.md]

## 实践启示

### 1. 领域 AI 的落地速度更快
如果需要 AI 在特定领域达到专家水平，领域专精 AI 比通用 AI 更快、更经济。^[raw/articles/anthropic-com-research-making-claude-a-chemist.md]


### 2. 领域评估是领域 AI 的关键
投资领域专家设计的评估集——评估质量决定领域 AI 的进步速度。^[raw/articles/anthropic-com-research-making-claude-a-chemist.md]


### 3. 领域 AI + 通用 AI 的组合策略
用领域 AI 做专业任务，通用 AI 做跨领域任务——两者组合优于单一模型。^[raw/articles/anthropic-com-research-making-claude-a-chemist.md]

Markdown Content:
_Summary: We’re working with world-class synthetic, computational, and analytical chemists to make Claude better at chemistry. In this post, we share our first work as part of this effort, in which Anthropic chemist, David Kamber, examines how Claude performs on a chemist’s most common analytical input, an NMR spectrum._ When working with molecules, chemists move between hand-drawn structures on a whiteboard, instrument readouts, database query strings, and the technical notations of patents and publications. Each of these representations encodes the same underlying chemistry, but each demands a different kind of fluency. A sketch of caffeine, for example, allows a chemist to spot its resemblance to adenosine, the body’s drowsiness signal, and predict that it keeps us alert by blocking the receptor. However, that same sketch cannot help a chemist tell it apart from other near-identical looking molecules. ^[raw/articles/anthropic-com-research-making-claude-a-chemist.md]

Understanding what molecule a chemist is working with is critical. Chemistry undergirds everything from the foods and medicine we ingest to our lotions, paints, and plastics. Reroute a handful of bonds among the same atoms, and glucose becomes fructose, molecules sharing a formula but processed through entirely different metabolic pathways. Flip a molecule into its mirror image, and a sedative becomes a teratogen, as happened in the [thalidomide](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21507989/) disaster.1 Chemists’ everyday work depends on reading these signals correctly across whichever representation befits a given task. ^[raw/articles/anthropic-com-research-making-claude-a-chemist.md]

Translating between these representations (chasing down a structure from a figure, reconciling an instrument readout against a proposed product, querying a database in the right notation) is time consuming and impossible to keep up with at scale—CAS, the largest chemistry registry, catalogs over 290 million disclosed substances and grows by roughly 15,000 new ones every day. ^[raw/articles/anthropic-com-research-making-claude-a-chemist.md]

AI is well-positioned to take on this research burden, yet it still remains largely aspirational in the context of chemistry. Machine-learning tools have been positioned for years as transformative for retrosynthesis—the process of working backward from a target molecule to simpler precursors to plan how to build it—reaction prediction, and property estimation, but the data those tools need have been hard to come by—sparse on null-results, inconsistent in format, and locked behind paywalls at subscription journals (and in unstructured supporting information). Retrosynthesis is a case in point—capable AI tools have existed for years, but adoption is uneven, and the average academic or small-lab chemist still doesn't use them. ^[raw/articles/anthropic-com-research-making-claude-a-chemist.md]

Even so, advancements in AI are finally reaching chemistry. Today’s frontier models are multimodal, and capable of explicit reasoning. They can read a chemical structure directly from a journal figure or hand sketch rather than depending on a pre-curated molecular database. And they can read the experimental detail of a methods section or supporting information in the form it is actually published. They can also show their reasoning step by step, which means a chemist can audit the outputs. None of this eliminates the data problem the field has been describing for years, but it changes which problems are tractable despite it. ^[raw/articles/anthropic-com-research-making-claude-a-chemist.md]

Ultimately, our claim is a modest one: Claude is starting to meaningfully assist chemists with the daily translation, recall, and integration work that complements their judgment, and we plan to keep extending its helpfulness. Today we are publishing the first white paper in the effort to accelerate this work. It tackles a chemist's most common analytical input: an NMR spectrum. ^[raw/articles/anthropic-com-research-making-claude-a-chemist.md]

Nearly every small molecule—drug, pesticide, dye, fragrance, polymer, DNA or protein subunit, and functional inorganic or solid-state material—exists because a chemist determined its structure. Given that these molecules cannot be seen with microscopes, chemists must rely on spectral analysis, probing a molecule with light, radio waves, or magnetic fields. The way a given molecule absorbs, emits, or deflects this energy gives chemists a pattern, or spectrum, with which they can elucidate its structure. ^[raw/articles/anthropic-com-research-making-claude-a-chemist.md]

NMR spectroscopy—one of the canonical techniques chemists rely on for this—is one of the most time-consuming ste ^[raw/articles/anthropic-com-research-making-claude-a-chemist.md]
